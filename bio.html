		<h1>Terence Tufuor: My Story</h1></div>
		<p>From the shores of Ghana to the deserts of Mars</p></div>

		<h2>Early Childhood</h2>
		<div id = "date">
		<h3>1994 - 2001 (birth to 7 years)</h3></div>
		<p>To be honest I don't remeber most of these years. A lot of what happened during these years are vague memories and stuff that was recounted to me. I was born in Ghana, West Africa on 27th December 1994. My family (2 parents and an older brother) lived in the capital city, Accra. Both of my parents worked; dad is a civil engineer and mum is a land economist. I attended the nursey school that my grandmother ran from teh age of 1 to 4. From what i remember I enjoyed it. I had a few friends and I could always go to my grandmothers house on the compound to have fun. After nursery school I attended Christ the King school for middle school and Junior Secondary School. I completed kindergarten 1st and 2nd grade between the ages of 5 and 7.</p>

		<h2>Formative years</h2>
		<div id = "date">
		<h3>2002 - 2009 (8 to 15 years)</h3></div>
		<p>I was an ok student in middle school and made a decent amount of friends. It was duringnthis period that I became really interested in electronics (as a child I loved to tear apart electronic devices just so I could see the insides). I got really interested in science, math and IT. At some point I dabbled in arts and crafts and got pretty good at sketching portraits of people. In the 8th and 9th grade I started studying hard for the BECE exams which every student had to take. These exams determined whether you got acceptance into the Secondary Schhol you wanted. There was a 5 month vacation period after the exams so I travelled to the USA and spent most of it in Boston.</p>

		<h2>Period of Maturation</h2>
		<div id = "date">
		<h3>2010 - present (16  to 22 years)</h3></div>
		<p>I enjoyed my time in Secondary school. I got admitted to the school I wanted and took the classes I was really interested in. It was a boarding school so it was the first time I was going to spend a large period of time away from my family. It was a semi-smooth transition. My housemates made my experience a lot of fun. I have so many fun stories and memories of our time together and I regularly keep in touch with most of them. I wrote the SAT's and then came to Tufts University to pursue a degree in Electrical Engineering. My first 3 years have been great. I've learnt a lot and met some really amazing people</p>

		<p>Now here we are. Senior year is finally here and I cant wait to see what it brings. I'll update this as times passes......peace
