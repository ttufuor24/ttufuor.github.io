		<h2>Work Experience:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><h3>Piaggio Fast Forward:</h3></li>
				<div id="date">
				<p>Summer 2016 - Present</p></div>
			<ul>
				<li><p>I design, build and test electrical hardware for the various subsystems on the company's latest platform robot</p></li>
				<li><p>I write software for the various subsystems I build. Some of the subsystems function as ROS nodes so they have to be programmed as such</p></li>
				<li><p>I perform general assembly duties such as crimping soldering and other tasks to put together the various components needed to let the robot run</p></li>
			</ul>

			<li><h3>Controls Robotics Identification and Signal Processing Lab</h3></li>
				<div id="date">
				<p>Summer 2015 - December 2015</p></div>
			<ul>
				<li><p>I worked on develping GPS free navigation for AR Parrot drones</p></li>
				<li><p>I implemented ROS software that gave the user the ability to create a predetermined fligh path for the drone using a script file of instrution</p></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<h2>Engineering Experience/Projects</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><h3>Formula Hybrid SAE</h3></li>
				<div id="date">
				<p>Fall 2013 - Present</p></div>
			<ul>
				<li><p>I designed the wireless data collection and transfer system on the car that communicates vital data about the condition of the car to the pit team. The data includes battery temperature, voltage and car speed</p></li>
				<li><p>I performed general assembly of the car including battery box assembly and motor controller programming</p></li>
			</ul>

			<li><h3>Swarmrobots for landmine location</h3></li>
				<div id="date">
				<p>Spring 2016</p></div>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Built 2 land robots that work together to locate landmines on a track. The landmines were simulated with magnets and located under colored tracks. The robots had to follow the track, locate the magnet and form a perimeter around it while using ultrasound signals to communicate with each other and a command center</p></li>
